# Surf or Pay 🌊🦈

**Stop procrastinating... or pay the price — literally.**

**Surf or Pay** is a strict accountability task tracker built for chronic procrastinators. Assign deadlines to your tasks, set a monetary forfeit, and appoint a friend as your "loan shark." If you miss the deadline, they get your cash. No excuses. No extensions.

## 🛠 Features

- **Surfer Mode**:  
  Add tasks with deadlines and forfeit amounts. Assign each task to a "shark" (a friend). Complete it in time, or your debt stays locked in.

- **Shark Mode**:  
  View and validate your friends’ task submissions. Reject incomplete tasks and claim overdue payments.

- **Friends System**:  
  Add friends using their email to assign or accept tasks and penalties.

- **Hand-Drawn Interface**:  
  Whimsical, custom illustrations for a fun yet fierce user experience.
